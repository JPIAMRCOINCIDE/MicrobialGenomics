> ## Prokaryotic microbes - Assembly, annotation, pangenome analysis and GWAS
> This practical is part of the Microbial Genomics practical course of Utrecht University
>  
> 1.  Working with genome assemblies, QC and annotation of genomes
> 2.  Pangenome analysis, genomic phylogenetic trees and GWAS

> ## Data
>
> We will make use of pneumococcal genomes of patients who have experienced invasive pneumococcal disease
> The dataset is described in the following papers: 
> [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788414](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788414) and [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28096486](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28096486)

In these lessons you will learn how to assemble genomes, how to check for problems in assemblies, how to annotate genomes, how to work with annotations, how to determine the pan genome and the core genome and finally you will associate gene presence/absence with phenotypes using contingency testing ("GWAS").
