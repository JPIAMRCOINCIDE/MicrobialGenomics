## Sequence assembly and assembly quality

Once your assembly has started, you can follow the lecture by Bas Dutilh. This lecture details assembly strategies, different kind of assemblers and ways of assessing assembly quality and binning of contigs when doing metagenomic assembly. 

The lecture can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHmMbPxKmn0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHmMbPxKmn0) 

The lecture takes 60 minutes.
