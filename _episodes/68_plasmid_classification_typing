title: "plasmid typing and classification"
start: false
teaching: 10
exercises: 30
questions:
- "How can we detect which contig is a plasmid and which is from the chromosome"
objectives:
- "Classifying plasmid contigs"
- "Typing plasmids"
- "Check which plasmids contain resistance genes"
keypoints:
- "Resistance genes can be found on the chromosome and on plasmids"
- "Plasmid classification by hand is time consuming. Especially with lots of contig, automated analysis is better"
- "There are also plasmids without resistance genes"

## RFPlasmid

[RFPlasmid](https://github.com/aldertzomer/RFPlasmid/tree/master) is often used to classify contigs in plasmid and chromosome. RFPlasmid processes folders, therefore we don't need a loop to process files.

## Plasmidtyping

$ cd barcode02
$ ls
$ cat plasmidtyper.txt

Where are the genes and where are the point mutations?
