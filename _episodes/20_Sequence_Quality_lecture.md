## Sequencing quality

Next up is a presentation on sequence read quality and sequencing methods. The slides are available on the teams site.

If you are following this course on your own you can make use of a prerecorded lecture by Professor Bas Dutilh, from Theoretical Biology and Bioinformatics at UU and Jena University in Germany. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdxVDy0lSAE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdxVDy0lSAE)

The lecture will take approximately 20 minutes. After that there is time for a break and time for asking questions.
