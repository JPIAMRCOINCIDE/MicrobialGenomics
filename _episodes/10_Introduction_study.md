## Introduction

We will be making use of the files on the MS Teams site. 
The Word document contains the link to the shared documents, the IP address of the server, etc. 

### Dataset

Introduction to the dataset is given in the powerpoint. In total we will be analyzing 62 genomes, of which one is a closed reference genome (OXC141).

### How to login

Follow the instructions at as before. 
The server we will be using has ip address 3.139.141.189. Please login using SSH (exactly like before). Use of MobaXterm, PuTTY, ssh is recommended. 

### Where are the files located

In your home folder (~/), you will find the directory "reads" which contains read files used in this study. As assembling of all the genomes in this study would be too time consuming, we will assembling only two genomes per person. We will combine the outputs of each person later on.
