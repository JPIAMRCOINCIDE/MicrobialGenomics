## Introduction

We will be making use of the files on the [Cocalc site](https://cocalc4.science.uu.nl/). 

### Dataset

Introduction to the dataset is given in the powerpoint. In total we will be analyzing 62 genomes, of which one is a closed reference genome (OXC141).

### How to login

Follow the instructions at as before. 
The server we will be using has host address [Cocalc site](https://cocalc4.science.uu.nl/). Please login using your webbrowser. Click on "New", top left and open a "Linux Terminal". Give it an appropriate name so you can find it again later. 

### Where are the files located

In your home folder (~/), you may find different files. It is your own responsibility to take care of your files. We will create the folders you will be using and download the read files that are part of this study. As assembling of all the genomes in this study would be too time consuming, we will assembling only two genomes per person. We will combine the outputs of each person later on. Familiarize yourself a bit with the terminal in Cocalc and then move to the next part of the course.
